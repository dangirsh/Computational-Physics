\underline{\bf \large Numerical Differentiation }
\end{center}

{\em
    You are not required to turn in a written solution to this homework problem.  
However, I will still hand out a solution set to give you an idea of the format of the 
homework solutions that will come later.  Note that the solution set that is handed out 
may occasionally contain a longer discussion of some subjects than is formally required.
}

Numerical differentiation techniques will be tested on the following function:
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x) & = & \sin(x) \exp ( -0.04x^2 )
\end{eqnarray}
The first derivative of $f(x)$, $f'(x)$ may be calculated three different way:
\begin{eqnarray}
f_{FD}'(x) & = & \frac{ f(x+h) - f(x) }{h} + \mathcal{O}(h) \mbox{~~~forward difference} \\
f_{BD}'(x) & = & \frac{ f(x) - f(x-h) }{h} + \mathcal{O}(h)  \mbox{~~~backward difference} \\
f_{CD}'(x) & = & \frac{ f(x+h) - f(x-h) }{2h} + \mathcal{O}(h^2) 
                \mbox{~~~central difference} 
\end{eqnarray}
where $h$ is small compared to $x$. The forward and backward difference methods may have 
a significantly larger error than the central difference method.  Alternately the forward and 
backward difference may be viewed as a central difference method offset by 
+h/2 and -h/2 respectively.  $f'(x)$ from all three methods was evaluated at 200 points 
between -7.0 and +7.0  using h=0.5 and h=0.05.  These three forms of the first derivative 
were calculated using the program listed at the end, and the results are shown
below along with the function $f(x)$ in Figure \ref{fbigh} and \ref{fsmallh} 
(FD= forward difference,  BD= 
backward difference, CD= central difference). The program was run twice, once with 
h=0.5 and once with h=0.05.  (The program also calculates the second derivative that 
follows.)

As can be seen from the Figure \ref{fbigh},  h=0.5 is too large and the three methods yield very 
different results.  The forward difference (FD) and the backward difference (BD)
appear to be shifted consistent with their interpretation as a shifted central difference.  
The second plot (Figure \ref{fsmallh}) with h=0.05 shows that this value of h is small
enough to yield an accurate (and consistent) calculation of the first derivative.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

\end{figure}

\resizebox{4.7in}{!}{\includegraphics{fig1b.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Finite first difference derivatives with h=0.05.
\label{fsmallh}}
\end{figure}

The second derivative may also be calculated numerically as:
\begin{eqnarray}
f''(x) & = & \frac{ f(x+h) -2f(x) + f(x-h) }{h^2} + \mathcal{O}(h^2)
\end{eqnarray}
The results are shown in the in Figure \ref{ffpp} below. In this range of $x$ the
$\exp()$ factor of
$f(x)$  does not change much so that the second derivative should be approximately:
\begin{eqnarray}
f''(x) & \sim & \exp ( -0.04x^2 ) \times \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}
    \left[ \sin(x) \right] = - f(x)
\end{eqnarray}
             
\begin{figure}[htb!]
\begin{center}
\leavevmode
\resizebox{4.7in}{!}{\includegraphics{fig1c.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{Second derivative with finite differences  (h=0.05).
\label{ffpp}}
\end{figure}

This means that the second derivative is similar to the negative of $f(x)$, which is
indeed apparent.
